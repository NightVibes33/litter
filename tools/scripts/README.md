# Shared Scripts (Planned)

iOS-focused automation scripts live here; legacy Android helpers may remain in the tree but are not part of supported builds.

- `codex-app-driver.applescript`: launches `Codex.app`, opens a project root, creates a thread, and pastes/sends prompts through GUI scripting for desktop-side conversation automation.
- `codex-desktop-controller.mjs`: launches or attaches to a remote-debugging-enabled `Codex.app` instance, then drives the real renderer UI through CDP so it can open projects, create threads, send prompts, wait for the turn to finish, and dump the visible transcript as JSON without macOS accessibility scripting.
- `ensure-ish-dev-random.sh`: repairs missing `/dev/null`, `/dev/random`, and `/dev/urandom` devices inside the iSH fakefs.
- `switch-app-identity.sh`: switches local iOS app IDs between `com.sigkitten.litter` and `com.<your-identifier>.litter` (`--to your-identifier --identifier <name>`), with optional `--team-id` for iOS signing. For iOS it updates `apps/ios/project.yml` and regenerates `apps/ios/Litter.xcodeproj` via `xcodegen` (no direct `.xcodeproj` edits).
- `triage-mobile-feedback.py`: rerunnable triage ledger for GitHub issues/PRs, TestFlight feedback/crashes; Google Play handling is legacy. It stores raw per-run snapshots, a durable local state file, and a generated board under `artifacts/mobile-triage/`.
- `verify-altstore-source.py`: validates the generated Litter KittyStore/AltStore source before publishing so every app version entry has a direct GitHub-release IPA URL, SHA-256 checksum, version/build/date metadata, positive size, and a matching direct-download news card.

Mobile triage flow:

```bash
# Fetch GitHub issues/PRs + TestFlight data for the last day and update the local board.
./tools/scripts/triage-mobile-feedback.py --last-hours 24

# Inspect active items without fetching again.
./tools/scripts/triage-mobile-feedback.py list --status active

# Mark work as handled so repeated fetches do not put it back in the active queue.
./tools/scripts/triage-mobile-feedback.py mark '<item-id>' --status done --note 'Fixed in <commit-or-version>'
./tools/scripts/triage-mobile-feedback.py mark '<item-id>' --status pr-open --note 'Fix PR #123'
```

The generated board is `artifacts/mobile-triage/triage-board.md`; the source of truth is `artifacts/mobile-triage/triage-state.json`.

Common `codex-desktop-controller.mjs` flows:

```bash
# Launch a separate Codex instance with Electron remote debugging enabled.
node tools/scripts/codex-desktop-controller.mjs launch \
  --app "/Applications/Codex copy.app" \
  --port 9333 \
  --user-data-dir /tmp/codex-desktop-controller-profile

# Reuse that same instance on later commands. Add --fresh-launch only if you
# intentionally want a brand new app instance on the same port/profile setup.
node tools/scripts/codex-desktop-controller.mjs thread-state --port 9333 --launch

# Attach to an already-running automation instance and inspect the active thread.
node tools/scripts/codex-desktop-controller.mjs thread-state --port 9333

# Send one turn into the current thread, wait for the assistant to finish, and print JSON.
node tools/scripts/codex-desktop-controller.mjs run-turn \
  --port 9333 \
  --message 'Reply with exactly: OK'

# Start a fresh thread in a sidebar project, run the first turn, and print the final transcript.
node tools/scripts/codex-desktop-controller.mjs run-turn \
  --port 9333 \
  --project codex-test \
  --message 'Reply with exactly: OK'
```
