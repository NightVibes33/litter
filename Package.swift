// Alternate SPM build entry for the iOS app. The production build path is the
// Xcode project generated from `apps/ios/project.yml` (see the Makefile iOS
// lanes), which links `libcodex_mobile_client.a` directly from
// `apps/ios/GeneratedRust/`. This manifest is kept so the Swift sources can
// also be compiled via SPM when a packaged `codex_mobile_client.xcframework`
// is present under `apps/ios/Frameworks/`.
